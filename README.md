IntoSpectrum
============

Server-side media player with a web front-end, written in NodeJS.

The interface is mainly based on [Bootstrap 3][].


Note that IntoSpectrum doesn't create the library for you,
at least not with the web app.

Instead, it comes with a *watchdog* utility script, which can be
launched once, or as a daemon process.

### Why IntoSpectrum ?

Its an anagram of the original author's last names, and also happens
to correspond to one of our favorite pokemon.
